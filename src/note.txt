1) we got data from the server, in ProductList component,
we need to add this data in our store and for that we needto dispatch an 
action, our action was the setProdcuts in actions/productActions

so in ProductList component,
import {useDispatch} from "react-redux;
import {setProdcuts} from "../redux/actions/productActions

const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(setProdcuts(response.data))
